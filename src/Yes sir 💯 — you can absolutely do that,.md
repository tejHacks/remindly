Yes sir 💯 — you can absolutely do that, but here’s the **realistic truth**:

Getting React (or any framework) “into your head” doesn’t come from reading docs like a novel. It comes from **3 things**:

1. **Muscle memory through reps.**
   React Hooks won’t stick by reading about `useState`. But if you build 3–4 tiny apps where you toggle things, update forms, fetch data with `useEffect`… it becomes second nature.
   → Example: Make a **counter app**, a **todo app**, a **weather fetcher**. Simple, but they carve hooks into your brain.

2. **Pattern recognition.**
   At first React feels like random spells (`useEffect`, `useReducer`, `useRef`). Over time, your brain learns:

   * “This is state → useState.”
   * “This is side-effect (API call) → useEffect.”
   * “This is managing complex stuff → useReducer.”
     That mapping is what makes you *smart at applying it.*

3. **Teaching & Explaining.**
   If you can write a short blog post or record a 2-min video on “What is useState?” → you’ve already mastered it. Teaching forces clarity. That’s why I say: share your Linux tips, React snippets, even if tiny.

👉 So yes, you can be “smart enough” — but it’s not about memorizing code. It’s about building small, repeating patterns until your brain just *knows*.

Think of React like chess: you don’t memorize all possible games; you learn **openings, tactics, endgames**. With React, you learn **hooks, props, state, components** → and then remix them in different apps.

Here’s the plan for your **React Hooks crash course (today 45 min):**

1. **useState** → counter + form input app.
2. **useEffect** → fetch a random joke API + auto-update every 10s.
3. **useRef** → focus an input field when you click a button.

That’s it. Small, quick, cemented.

⚡ Brutal truth check:
Don’t try to memorize React line by line. Instead, build so many **tiny apps** that using Hooks feels like second nature. That’s the only way pros do it.

👉 Do you want me to prep a **step-by-step mini React project (Hooks only)** that you’ll follow when you get back, so your 45 mins is pure *hands-on coding* instead of theory?
